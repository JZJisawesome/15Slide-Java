# 15Slide-Java
An almost identical port of [15Slide](jzjisawesome.github.io) to Java 11.

This is (obviously) based on the 15Slide project, which is licenced under the [MIT licence](https://github.com/JZJisawesome/15Slide/blob/master/LICENSE). It is meant to _coexist_ with the original, and be compatible with its save files.
